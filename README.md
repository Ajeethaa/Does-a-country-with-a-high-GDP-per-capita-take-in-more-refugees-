# InvestigateDataset


The aim of this project is to investigate correlation between wealth of a country and its intake of refugees. The notion that I have adopted is wealthier countries should take in more refugees. The analysis will use GDP per capita, size of population and the rate of intake yearly.  

To simplify the scope of the project, I will only be analysing three countries. I chose these countries using their GDP per capita in the year 2017. The three countries are in the order of highest, lowest and the average amongst the list of countries. All data therein are from Gapminder.com.
